# Technical SEO Audit Automation

This project automates the process of analyzing Screaming Frog exports, identifying technical SEO issues, and generating prioritized recommendations based on impact and effort.

## Overview

The Technical SEO Audit Automation system consists of:

1. A core Python script that processes Screaming Frog exports and identifies common technical issues
2. A workflow script that automates the entire process from data import to report generation
3. Customizable report templates that present findings by priority level

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - xlsxwriter
  - argparse

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib xlsxwriter argparse
```

## Quick Start

1. Run a Screaming Frog crawl of your site and export the data
2. Clone this repository to your machine
3. Run the workflow script:

```bash
python workflow.py --domain example.com --exports_path /path/to/screaming_frog_exports
```

4. View the generated reports in the `outputs/example.com_TIMESTAMP/reports/` directory
